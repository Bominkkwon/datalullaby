Turning images into music through reproducible sonification

What it is

DataLullaby is an image-to-music sonification engine that translates visual data into sound. It converts research images into structured musical compositions using consistent, explainable rules.

This is not generative music inspired by images.
It is a deterministic system that treats sound as an alternate interface for data.

Why it exists

Many patterns in data are difficult to notice visually but easy to hear. DataLullaby provides a second perceptual channel for understanding structure, change, and repetition in images.

It is designed for:

Research exploration

Accessibility and multimodal analysis

Creative work grounded in real data

How it works

DataLullaby processes each image through a fixed pipeline:

Normalize
Images are resized and brightness-normalized so formatting differences do not affect output.

Extract structure
The system identifies brightness distributions, edges, regions, and gradients that describe the image’s structure.

Map to music
Visual features are translated into musical parameters such as time, pitch, volume, duration, and timbre using consistent mapping rules.

Apply constraints
Musical constraints (scales, ranges, rhythm) ensure the output is listenable without altering the underlying data.

Generate sound
The system produces a complete musical piece through synthesis or MIDI output.

The same image will always produce the same sound.

What it outputs

For each image, DataLullaby generates:

Audio files (WAV or MP3)

MIDI files

Visual timelines aligning image structure with sound

Metadata linking image and audio output

Each output is reproducible and traceable back to the source image.

What makes it different

Deterministic – no randomness, no hidden prompts

Explainable – every sound maps back to visual structure

Scalable – processes single images or large datasets

Cross-disciplinary – useful for research, accessibility, and art

Core idea

Images represent information frozen in space.
Music represents information unfolding in time.

DataLullaby translates between the two.
